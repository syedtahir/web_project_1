The main problem with education

Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the subject material? All you've really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over, the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

Conclusion: Knowing how to study is absolutely essential, but for some reason, this point is too often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?

There are certain techniques and exercises that can be applied to the learning process to help make it more efficient and engaging. This is exactly what we do at Practicum.

Five Strategies from Barbara Oakley

Two Ways of Thinking 
Deep understanding comes from being able to toggle back and forth between focused and diffused thinking.

Recall 
Improving your ability to remember key bits of information help to connect different part of the brain.

Interleaving 
When you learn multiple skills at the same time, they reinforce each other.

Questions 
When listening to your teacher, think up a good question, something that you're really itching to know.

Illusion of Competence 
Test yourself, write it down, tell other people, and repeat the process in different settings. Only then can you be truly certain you've understood something.

Barbara Oakleyâ€™s story. 

Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of herself as more of a 
humanities person, and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after 
school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, 
during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study 
engineering. In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was 
forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out that when something 
doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people 
may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
